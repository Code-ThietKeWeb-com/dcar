Installation Guide

================================================================================

* Prerequisites: 

(a) Make sure you have a web server where the CMS-vnTRUST will be deployed. 

(b) Make sure that your web server is capable of serving the web pages written in 
    PHP (http://www.php.net). 

(c) Make sure you have one of the supported databases installed. 
    - MySQL version 3.22.x or higher. (http://www.mysql.com) 

================================================================================

* Installation: 

The installation process is pretty straightforward and requires minimal 
adjustment of the application files. Proceed as follows: 

1. Extract the files from archive 
Extract the files into a folder within your web server hierarchy from where 
the application will be served. 

Windows users could use WinZip to extract files from archive.

Ensure that the folder name does not have spaces in it. During the process of 
unzipping, make sure that the files are unzipped to their respective folders. 
Don't simply open the zip archive and drag all the files to the same folders. 
For the application to work correctly, some files such as the image files need 
to be in specific folders. 

================================================================================

2. Prepare a database 

If you do not have a database already, create a database. 
In MySQL you use the "mysqladmin" program like this: 
mysqladmin -uuser -ppaswword create mydb 

Be sure that you have a user for that database which has the rights to select,
insert, update, delete. 
A MySQL Grant statement for this user would look like this: 
GRANT 
  select, insert, update, create, alter, delete, drop 
ON 
 database.* 
TO 
 user@localhost 
IDENTIFIED BY 
 'password'; 

================================================================================
3. Quick Install
(a) Change the permissions on these files and folders to be writeable by 
all (777 or drwxrwxrwx within your FTP Client) 
	_config.php
	last.dat
	db_backup/exports
	upload
	upload/banner
	upload/logo
	uploader/files
	pages_images
	news_images
	news_images/thumbs

(b) Using your web browser visit the location you placed CMS-vnTRUST
   e.g. http://www.mydomain.com/install/

(c) The installation is divided logically in two steps. In the first part you 
   provide database settings and create database table.
   In the second part you decide which settings you want to use.
   Fill out all the requested information and hit Submit each step.

(d) Revisit the location you entered above
   e.g. http://www.mydomain.com/index.php

(e) Online Clinic should now be available.

NOTE: the following  steps are not needed if the installation had completed
successfully

================================================================================
4. PHP for Windows 
For PHP for Windows do the following: 

(a) Open php.ini (it can be found in the Windows folder) 
(b) Find session.save_path parameter. 
E.g.: session.save_path = C:\Program Files\PHP\sessiondata\ ; 
argument passed to save_handler 
(c) Verify that set as a value for this parameter exists and not a Read-Only 
file for the Web-Server. 

================================================================================

5. Verify if all things works 
To verify if all things works simply point your browser to 
http://"your_web_server"/"path_to_CMS-vnTRUST" 
where: 

"your_web_server" - might be "localhost" or (if installed on remote web server) internet domain name like "www.your_company.com". 
"path_to_CMS-vnTRUST" - The directory within web-server hierarchy where Online Clinic was installed.
